# AI Snippet Service

A full-stack app that generates and stores AI summaries of text.

Backend: Node.js 20, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, OpenAI API
Frontend: React, Remix, Tailwind CSS

## Notes
- The OpenAI API key must be kept secret â€” do not commit it to source control.
- This service assumes an AI provider (e.g. OpenAI) is available and responsive.
- The UI and API are structured in separate folders, as per the challenge requirements. If preferred, these could easily be split into separate repositories.

## ðŸš€ Setup

### Local setup
-  Create a .env file at the root of the mono-repo (above frontend/ and backend/):

## Environment variables
  - Variable	Example / Default
    `MONGO_URI`	mongodb://mongo:27017/ai-snippet
    `OPENAI_API_KEY`	your OpenAI key
    `BACKEND_PORT`	3000
    `FRONTEND_PORT`	3030
    `REMIX_API_URL`	http://localhost:3000

- Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with a valid key (see instructions at the end).

- Backend
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run dev         # Run in dev mode
    npm run test        # Run tests

- Frontend
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev         # Run in dev mode
    npm run test        # Run tests


## Docker
To build, run tests, start the API (port 3000) and also the UI project (port 3030):

- docker compose up --build

This will:
âœ… Build the app
âœ… Run API tests
âœ… MongoDB is available on port 27017
âœ… Start the API server on port 3000
âœ… Run UI tests
âœ… Start the UI server on port 3030

## Environment variables
- MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/ai-snippet
- OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
- BACKEND_PORT=3000 (3000 will be the default if none is given)
- FRONTEND_PORT=3030 (3030 will be the default if none is given)
- REMIX_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 (default will be 3000 if none is given)

OBS: Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` value with a valid OpenAI API key
ðŸ‘‰ You can obtain a key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
Or step by step in the end of this file

## API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /snippets | Create & save a snippet, return AI summary |
| GET |  /snippets:id | Retrieve a single snippet by ID |
| GET | /snippets | Retrieve list of all snippets |

## UI features
 - Submit text â†’ receive AI-generated summary
 - List all snippets in a table (scrollable)
 - Search snippet by ID
 - Clean UI with Tailwind CSS
 - TDD discipline â€” tests alongside implementation

## Example request with curl
Create a snippet and get its summary:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/snippets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "This is the raw text to summarize."}'

Retrieve a specific snippet:
curl http://localhost:3000/snippets/<snippet-id>
- Replace <snippet-id> with the actual ID returned by the POST call.

Retrieve all snippets:
curl http://localhost:3000/snippets

## Run tests
 - npm run test (LOCAL)
 - docker compose run --build api (Docker)

## Post-challenge reflection
  - Backend
    - Add proper error handling layers (e.g., global error middleware)
    - Add input validation (e.g., using Zod or Joi)
    - Implement simple authentication (e.g., JWT for snippet ownership)
    - Write more integration and edge case tests (e.g., large payloads, AI API timeouts)
    - Set up a CI pipeline with GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and Docker build (as requested)
    - Explore caching AI summaries to reduce external API calls

  - Frontend
    - If I had more time, I would:
    - Add client-side form validation with more nuanced error messages and better UX (e.g. inline feedback rather than alerts).
    - Enhance UI/UX: loading indicators for all async actions, pagination for snippets, and smoother transitions.
    - Add e2e tests (e.g. Playwright or Cypress) to cover user flows.

## Trade-offs made
 - Backend
    - Focused on core functionality within time budget; kept prompt to OpenAI simple.
    - Minimal validation and no auth to prioritize clean API structure and Docker integration.
    - Did not implement streaming summaries (Server-Sent Events) or roles.

  - Frontend
    - Chose simplicity over full error handling: e.g., some API failure states are shown via basic alert rather than UI components.
    - Focused on functionality over polish: UI is clean but minimal, with room for visual refinement.

## How to generate an OpenAI API key
1) Go to OpenAIâ€™s platform
2) Log in or create an account
3) Once youâ€™re logged in: click on your profile icon (top-right corner), in the dropdown menu, click "View API keys"
4) Create a new API key: On the API keys page click the "Create new secret key" button, optionally, give your key a name (e.g. ai-snippet-service), the platform will generate the key
5) Copy and store the key safely: IMPORTANT Youâ€™ll only see the key once. Copy it immediately and store it in a safe place (e.g., your .env file, a password manager).
6) Use the key in your app: Your app will read this value from your .env file or environment variable.


## Final notes
  The project meets the core challenge goals:
    - Clean separation of API & UI
    - Dockerized and tested
    - Clear setup instructions
